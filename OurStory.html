    <p class="info">West Pymble’s iconic Du Plessy Pralin and Otello shop is a beacon for chocolate lovers all over Sydney.<br><br>
    It was the current owner Paul Adam’s parents, Marcel and Martha, who founded Du Pressy Pralin at Pymble in 1961.<br><br>
    Marcel had learned his craft as a master pastry chef and patisserie in Switzerland.<br><br>
    Following a period in London after the Second World War, where he cooked for Winston Churchill, Marcel and Martha left their Strasbourg, France, home and migrated to Australia.<br><br>
    After working at the Snowy Mountains Hydro Scheme, they moved to Sydney where they opened Du Plessy Pralin in Pymble, pioneering the delicious hand-made chocolates and building the reputation so richly deserved.<br><br>
    Paul took over the business, joining his mother Martha, after Marcel passed away in 1979.<br><br>
    In 1988 Paul expanded the business by purchasing Otello Chocolates of Mosman.<br><br>
    At its present home in the West Pymble shopping centre, Du Plessy Pralin offers a delicious assortment of special gateaux and chocolates, including its renowned after-dinner slices in a variety of flavours.<br><br>
    Paul’s Easter and Christmas chocolates are special treats for any connoisseur of fine food.</p>
