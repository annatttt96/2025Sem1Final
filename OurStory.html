<p class="story">West Pymble’s iconic Du Plessy Pralin and Otello shop is a beacon for chocolate lovers all over Sydney.</p>
<p class="story">It was the current owner Paul Adam’s parents, Marcel and Martha, who founded Du Pressy Pralin at Pymble in 1961.</p>
<p class="story">Marcel had learned his craft as a master pastry chef and patisserie in Switzerland.</p>
<p class="story">Following a period in London after the Second World War, where he cooked for Winston Churchill, Marcel and Martha left their Strasbourg, France, home and migrated to Australia.</p>
<p class="story">After working at the Snowy Mountains Hydro Scheme, they moved to Sydney where they opened Du Plessy Pralin in Pymble, pioneering the delicious hand-made chocolates and building the reputation so richly deserved.</p>
<p class="story">Paul took over the business, joining his mother Martha, after Marcel passed away in 1979.</p>
<p class="story">In 1988 Paul expanded the business by purchasing Otello Chocolates of Mosman.</p>
<p class="story">At its present home in the West Pymble shopping centre, Du Plessy Pralin offers a delicious assortment of special gateaux and chocolates, including its renowned after-dinner slices in a variety of flavours.</p>
<p class="story">Paul’s Easter and Christmas chocolates are special treats for any connoisseur of fine food.</p>
